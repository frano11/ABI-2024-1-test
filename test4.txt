The screen of my computer is a bit blurry, but nevermind, I have the secret to make it clean.
And this one is very simple: just clean with a dry soft cloth. In circular motion, don't forget it!
But now, if you are annoyed by the fingerprints on the screen, then you might consider using 70% isopropyl alcohol.
Furthermore, you can vacuumclean your keyword. Alternatively, you can send your computer to the computer store.
However, I would also say, that it's better to avoid that by just changing certain habits when working with your computer.
For example, avoid touching your screen, specially when your hands touched food.
Finally, either wash your hands and do not eat or drink when working with yiur computer.
